About The Project-
We have combined together and created a website and hosted it on Netlify. The website is about Finance Learning for kids. In this website we have at first given content which the children can go through and learn about Finance.
Then we have added quizes after every chapter so that the kids can test their knowledge about the topics.
We have also added real life prices of different stocks.
At last we have added a finance tracker where the kids can add all their expenses and this can create a budget to manage their expenses.
